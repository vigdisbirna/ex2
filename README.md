# Exquisitor 2.0
- Exquisitor is a browser-based media explorer capable of learning user preferences in real-time during interactions with the 100 million images of the YFCC100M collection. 
- The system owes its efficiency to the Blackthorn interactive multimodal learning engine and the eCP high-dimensional indexing algorithm. 
- Exquisitor can complete each interaction round in less than 10 ms, using only a single CPU core with a modest memory footprint, which opens up large-scale multimedia analytics to consumer PCs, as well as multi-user and multi-platform environments. 
- Implemented as a summer project at Reykjavik University in 2018 with the focus on using an eye-tracker to control the web interface.
